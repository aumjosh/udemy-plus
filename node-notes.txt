# webpack is a tool that will bundle your files
# the wordpress-scripts package configures webpack for wordpress

# create an /src directory
# the scripts package has been configured to process files created in the /src directory


# 2 commands for processing our files are:
npm run start # refreshes the bundle on updates
npm run build # for when you are fininshed with development

# npm run start -- searches for the index file and creates a log of all files found

# now the /build folder should have been created
